In this program I have created a coffee shop app.

Onboarding - I have shown three features of app search ,filter option and add to cart.

I have Used Firebase email and password authentication for Login

 #email-Mitalibansode2@gmail.com, password-123456

On home screen there is a searchbar to search for coffee products .
you can select the option to choose the product.

I have used Coffee api to get product image and title 

There is Filter button on bottom corner to choose filter options.
